  - Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)
  - HTML or XHTML
  - DocBook
  - OpenDocument (.odt)

SimpleTeX4ht doesnâ€™t include TeX4ht. 
Note : TeX4ht is part of the The MacTeX Distribution.

SimpleTeX4ht is currently available in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian and Brazilian Portuguese.

Requirements: SimpleTeX4ht runs natively on both Power PC and Intel based Macintosh computers with Mac OS X 10.5 or later.

SimpleTeX4ht is simple but also powerful. TeX4ht is typically run from the UNIX command line by doing something like htlatex filename "options1" "option2" "options3" "options4". The expert tab brings you all the power of TeX4ht. Advanced users can specify their own options, depending on their needs. SimpleTeX4ht is a GUI to make TeX4ht friendlier to use.

For the best display, some TeX constructions, such formulas and equations may be rendered as images in the converted file.
